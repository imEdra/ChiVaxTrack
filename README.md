# ChiVaxTrack | Chicago Vaccine Tracker
**View the live website at [**https://chivaxtrack.herokuapp.com/**](https://chivaxtrack.herokuapp.com/)**

A live COVID-19 vaccine tracker built using create-react-app, TailwindCSS, axios, and created by a Chicago Public Schools student (Not-so-fun fact, I accidentally deleted the first version of this website and I had to recode everything :p). This utilizes publicly availble data from the City of Chicago.
